# Minimal SkyGfx

This stripped down version retains only the timecyc based colour filter from the original project.
It applies the PS2 style post-processing using data from `timecyc.dat`. All other rendering
features have been removed. The filter automatically adjusts to different hours of the day
and weather presets.

The colour filter has been tweaked to appear slightly warmer and less bright
during daytime hours.
